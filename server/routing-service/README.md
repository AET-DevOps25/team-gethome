# GetHome Routing Service

The Routing Service is a core component of the GetHome application that provides safe route planning with danger zone avoidance for solo pedestrians, particularly in late-night settings.

## Features

### üõ£Ô∏è Safe Route Planning
- Calculate optimal walking routes using OpenRouteService API
- Avoid reported danger zones based on crowd-sourced safety data
- Provide turn-by-turn navigation instructions
- Calculate safety scores for routes

### üö® Danger Zone Management
- Allow users to report unsafe locations (parks, alleys, etc.)
- Crowd-sourced danger zone database with expiration
- Categorize danger levels (LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, CRITICAL)
- Tag-based organization (alley, poor_lighting, etc.)

### üÜò Emergency Handling
- Process emergency triggers from users
- Integrate with message service for emergency notifications
- Send location and context to emergency contacts
- Support both manual and audio-based emergency detection

## Architecture

### Services
- **RoutingService**: Main route planning logic with danger zone avoidance
- **DangerZoneService**: Management of danger zone reports and queries
- **SafetyAnalysisService**: Calculate safety scores based on nearby danger zones
- **EmergencyService**: Handle emergency situations and notifications

### External Integrations
- **OpenRouteService**: Free-tier routing API for walking directions
- **UserManagementService**: Get user profiles and emergency contacts
- **MessageService**: Send emergency notifications to contacts

### Data Models
- **Route**: Complete route information with segments and safety metrics
- **DangerZone**: Geospatial danger zone data with metadata
- **RouteRequest/Response**: API DTOs for route planning

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Java 17+
- MongoDB
- OpenRouteService API key (free tier available)

### Running Locally
```bash
# Build the project
./gradlew build

# Run the application
./gradlew bootRun
```

```bash
# Build image
docker build -t gethome-routing-service .

# Run container
docker run -p 8084:8084 gethome-routing-service
```

## Safety Algorithm

The service uses a sophisticated safety scoring algorithm:

1. **Danger Zone Detection**: Find all active danger zones within 2km of route
2. **Distance Calculation**: Calculate minimum distance from route segments to danger zones
3. **Risk Assessment**: 
   - Base risk based on danger level (LOW=0.1, MEDIUM=0.3, HIGH=0.6, CRITICAL=0.9)
   - Distance factor (closer = higher risk)
   - Report count factor (more reports = higher risk)
4. **Safety Score**: Convert total risk to safety score (0.0 to 1.0)

## Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
./gradlew test

# Run specific test class
./gradlew test --tests RoutingServiceTest

# Run with coverage
./gradlew test jacocoTestReport
```

## Monitoring

The service includes:
- Health check endpoint: `/actuator/health`
- Prometheus metrics: `/actuator/prometheus`
- Application metrics and logging

## Contributing

1. Follow the existing code structure and patterns
2. Add comprehensive tests for new features
3. Update documentation for API changes
4. Ensure all tests pass before submitting
