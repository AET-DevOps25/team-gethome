3. **Impact Analysis**: Compares current vs baseline performance
4. **Automated Reporting**: Sends detailed Slack reports with recommendations

### **Impact Assessment Levels**

| Impact Level | Criteria | Recommendation | Action |
|--------------|----------|----------------|--------|
| **🟢 Healthy** | All metrics within 5% of baseline | Continue monitoring | Standard validation |
| **🟡 Warning** | 1-3 metrics degraded 5-10% | Investigate | Enhanced monitoring |
| **🔴 Critical** | >3 metrics degraded OR >10% degradation | Consider rollback | Immediate investigation |

### **Tracked Metrics During Deployment**

**Business Metrics**:
- Safety score average (degradation threshold: 5%)
- Emergency response efficiency (threshold: 10%)  
- User engagement score (threshold: 5%)
- Route optimization effectiveness (threshold: 5 percentage points)

**Technical Metrics**:
- API success rates (threshold: 2 percentage points)
- System availability (threshold: 1%)
- Response times (threshold: 30 seconds increase)
